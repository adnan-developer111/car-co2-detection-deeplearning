# car-co2-detection-deeplearning
Deep learning model for high-accuracy CO₂ emission detection and estimation in cars using AI-based analysis of sensor data.

## 🧠 Project Structure – Professional Overview

This project follows a **clean, research-style structure**, similar to professional AI projects used in companies and universities.  
Each folder has a specific role:


### 📊 `data/`  → Dataset
This folder contains the **main dataset (`co2.csv`) with 7,385 real car samples**.  
It includes engine size, cylinder count, and fuel consumption data that are used to predict CO₂ emissions using machine learning.

- Example: `data/co2.csv`  
- Purpose: Real-world input features for training the AI model  


### 🧪 `src/`  → Jupyter Experiments
Contains all AI experiments, data preprocessing, and model training code.  
The notebook **`Neural-Networks.ipynb`** is the **core file** where the model is trained and tested.

This is the main research notebook used for:
- data analysis  
- training the neural network  
- evaluating model performance  


### 🧠 `images/`  → Neural Network Architecture
This folder contains the **network architecture diagram**, showing how AI learns from inputs to predict CO₂ levels.  
It visually explains the deep learning model and the layer-to-layer flow.

- Example: `images/Neural-Networks.png` → **visual neural network structure**
